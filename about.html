			<p>We represent a broad cross section of talent across the United States with many decades of combined industry experience in design, test, checkout and maintenance of flight hardware, Ground Support Equipment (GSE) systems and large public transportation buses.</p>

			<p>Following the formal announcement of the Space Shuttle Program cancellation by President G. W. Bush in 2006, Martin Belson knew as a Shuttle employee at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida that there would be much great talent loss from the American Space Program. He began to take notice of the rich NASA Inspired technology and talent that surrounded him. Martin began to lay out a plan. The first important asset realized was the outstanding quality of the people that he worked with for many years- their work ethics, commitment, dependability, skill and their unique experiences were some of the best in the world. There was no doubt that this was a winning combination that would serve him to create employment for himself and other KSC workers. Second, as one of the co-inventors of the SMART software, Martin applied for, and was awarded by NASA, exclusive technology rights to market and sell the SMART software following his retirement from KSC in October of 2010. That is where the NASA Inspired SMART software commercializing began.</p>
